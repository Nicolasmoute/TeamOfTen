# TeamOfTen — Full Specs

Comprehensive reference for every spec considered since the app's inception. Merges the original design (Docs/HARNESS_SPEC.md) with everything that has actually shipped, plus paths deliberately not taken.

**Three companion docs**:
- **[Docs/HARNESS_SPEC.md](Docs/HARNESS_SPEC.md)** — the original design spec (frozen reference; section numbers preserved here so you can cross-read).
- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — project context for Claude sessions (what's done / next likely / known gotchas).
- **This doc** — the superset: original intent, evolution, current surface, open questions, scrapped ideas.

---

## 1. Vision

### 1.1 Primary goals (unchanged since day 0)

1. **Run 1 Coach + 10 Players in parallel** on a single VPS, all using Claude Agent SDK authenticated via one Max-plan OAuth session. Shared billing; no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` path.
2. **Full transparency** — every agent's activity visible in UI; no hidden orchestration.
3. **Shared state** — common task board, common memory, direct inter-agent messaging.
4. **Access anywhere** — tiling multi-pane desktop UI, single-view mobile (mobile polish still pending).
5. **Disposable VPS** — nothing permanent on the server; durable state on Infomaniak kDrive via WebDAV.
6. **Easy deploy** — one repo, one service, auto-deploy on push (Zeabur → GitHub main).
7. **`/loop` friendly** — agents run semi-autonomously with bounded iteration caps; human interjections via inbox.

### 1.2 Explicit non-goals

- Multi-user / multi-tenant.
- API-key billing (the whole point is Max-plan sharing).
- Enterprise compliance features.
- Beating Anthropic's Agent Teams — this is specifically **more transparent and less automagical**.
- Persistent pause state — deliberately in-memory, restart resumes.
- Automatic `tasks.parent_id` cycle detection at the DB level (defensive `seen` guard in UI walk is enough).

## 2. The Team (11 agents, sports metaphor)

### 2.1 Roles

| ID | Kind | Name | Role | Default model |
|----|------|------|------|--------------|
| `coach` | Coach | fixed: "Coach" | Team captain — decomposes goals, assigns work, synthesizes progress | Sonnet (configurable) |
| `p1`…`p10` | Players | **assigned by Coach** (e.g. "Alice", "Ravi") | **assigned by Coach** (e.g. "Developer — writes code", "QA — runs tests") | Sonnet, per-pane override |

Player names and roles are written via `coord_set_player_role(player_id, name, role)` (Coach-only). Slots `p1`…`p10` are permanent; names/roles rotate with projects.

### 2.2 The rule: Coach orders, Players report

Two enforcement layers — **soft** (system prompts) and **hard** (structural).

Soft:
- Coach's system prompt: "you delegate, never implement".
- Player's: "you execute and report, you do not assign work to peers".

Hard:
- Only Coach can create top-level tasks. Players can create subtasks only (parent_id must be an owned task).
- Only Coach can call `coord_set_player_role` and `coord_write_decision`.
- Only Coach can call `coord_assign_task` (push-assign to a Player).
- Players are the only kind that can call `coord_commit_push`, `coord_claim_task`.
- Structural tool permissioning via `ALLOWED_COACH_TOOLS` vs `ALLOWED_PLAYER_TOOLS` in `server/tools.py`.

Messaging (`coord_send_message`) is open to both — Players can inform each other ("finished migration, FYI") but cannot assign work.

### 2.3 Why 10 Players specifically

Max-plan realistic concurrency is lower than 10 for continuous loops. The roster defines *potential* slots, not *always-on* agents. Coach activates the slots it needs — typically 2–5 concurrent during active work.

---

## 3. Tech stack (as deployed)

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Agent runtime | Claude Agent SDK (Python) | Programmatic control; Max-plan OAuth; native streaming |
| Backend | FastAPI + WebSocket + aiosqlite | Single-process, shared in-memory state |
| Frontend | Preact 10 + htm + Split.js (no build step) | ESM from esm.sh; zero build, fast load |
| UI state | Local `useState` + `useMemo` (no Zustand) | Simpler than originally spec'd |
| Hot-path DB | SQLite on `/data/harness.db`, DELETE journal mode | ACID; no race conditions; volume-friendly |
| Durable mirror | Infomaniak kDrive via WebDAV (webdav4 lib) | Swiss hosting; human-readable; no rclone daemon |
| Auth to Claude | `claude /login` device-code flow per host | OAuth tokens in OS credential store (NOT `~/.claude.json`) |
| Auth to UI | Bearer token (`HARNESS_TOKEN`), optional | Personal-use; token gate + localStorage paste UX |
| Deploy | Docker container on Zeabur, auto-pulled from GitHub `main` | No Caddy needed (Zeabur handles TLS) |

### 3.1 Deviations from the original spec

| Original | Shipped | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| React + react-mosaic + Vite | Preact + htm + Split.js | No build step; simpler |
| Zustand for state | Plain React hooks | Scope didn't justify a store |
| Docker Compose (app + Caddy) | Single Dockerfile on Zeabur | Zeabur owns ingress / TLS |
| `~/.claude.json` copy script | `claude /login` device-code per host | M-1 spike proved OAuth tokens aren't in that file |
| `curl https://claude.ai/install.sh` | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | Zeabur EU region 403s the install.sh host |
| `workspaces/` gitignored plain dirs | Per-Player git worktrees under `/workspaces/<slot>/project/` on `work/<slot>` branches | M4 design |
| One-tier WebDAV state | Two-tier: SQLite hot + kDrive durable | WebDAV too slow/race-prone for 11 concurrent writers |
| Tailscale-only deploy | Public Zeabur deploy + optional bearer token | Switched preference pre-M0 |

---

## 4. Data model

All stored in SQLite. In-memory representations are plain dicts (we dropped the pydantic models from the original spec — SQLite rows + Pydantic request validators are enough).

### 4.1 Agent

Columns: `id`, `kind ∈ {coach, player}`, `name`, `role`, `status ∈ {stopped, idle, working, waiting, error}`, `current_task_id`, `model` (default `claude-sonnet-4-6`), `workspace_path`, `session_id`, `cost_estimate_usd`, `started_at`, `last_heartbeat`.

11 seed rows on init (idempotent): `coach` + `p1`…`p10`.

### 4.2 Task

Columns: `id`, `title`, `description`, `status ∈ {open, claimed, in_progress, blocked, done, cancelled}`, `owner` (FK agents.id), `created_by` (`'human'` or agent id), `created_at`, `claimed_at`, `completed_at`, `parent_id` (FK tasks.id), `priority ∈ {low, normal, high, urgent}`, `tags` (JSON array), `artifacts` (JSON array).

Indexed on status / owner / parent_id.

### 4.3 Message

Columns: `id AUTOINC`, `from_id` (agent id or `'human'`), `to_id` (agent id or `'broadcast'`), `subject`, `body`, `sent_at`, `read_at` (legacy; unused after v0.4.1), `in_reply_to`, `priority ∈ {normal, interrupt}`.

### 4.4 Message reads (broadcast tracking)

Junction table `(message_id, agent_id)` with `read_at`. Needed because one broadcast has N recipients — a single `read_at` on the message itself would fire the first time any recipient drains.

### 4.5 Event

Columns: `id AUTOINC`, `ts`, `agent_id`, `type`, `payload` (JSON blob).

Append-only; the audit log. Full event-type enumeration lives in §7.2.

### 4.6 Memory doc

Columns: `topic PK`, `content`, `last_updated`, `last_updated_by`, `version`.

Topic validated by `MEMORY_TOPIC_RE = r"^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]{0,63}$"` — prevents path traversal when the same topic names a file on kDrive.

### 4.7 Locks (deferred)

Originally spec'd; not implemented. Per-worktree isolation covers the primary need. If re-added later, filename: `/state/locks.json` on kDrive or a `locks` table.

---

## 5. Storage layout

### 5.1 Two-tier: hot SQLite + durable kDrive

**Hot state (single source of truth)**: SQLite on `/data/harness.db`. All 11 agents' tool calls write through the harness server process (see §6.1).

**Durable mirror (kDrive, when configured)**:
- `memory/<topic>.md` — mirrors every `coord_update_memory` synchronously.
- `decisions/<date>-<slug>.md` — append-only architectural records, Coach-only via `coord_write_decision`.
- `events/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` — today's events flushed every 5 min (`HARNESS_KDRIVE_FLUSH_INTERVAL`). During UTC 00:00–02:00 yesterday's file is re-flushed so late events don't get lost at the day boundary.
- `snapshots/<ts>.db` — hourly `VACUUM INTO` of the full DB. Retention capped at `HARNESS_KDRIVE_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` (default 48 ≈ 2 days hourly).

### 5.2 Why not one-tier WebDAV

WebDAV is too slow and race-prone under 11 concurrent writers. Original spec intended `tasks.json` / `agents.json` / per-agent inboxes on kDrive directly; early design showed this failing under contention.

### 5.3 Memory is scratchpad (intentionally no history)

If history matters, the event log (`memory_updated` events) has the audit. Decisions is the append-only durable record; memory is the "living now" commons.

---

## 6. Coordination mechanics

### 6.1 Single write-handle discipline

All state mutations (tasks, messages, memory, events, agent status) route through the harness server process. The server holds the only SQLite write handle. Agents never open their own DB connection; they call MCP tools.

This gives:
- Clean event ordering (one serial stream, auditable).
- Trivial concurrency (no file locks, no optimistic-concurrency retry loops).
- Single place to publish events to the WS bus.

### 6.2 Per-worktree isolation > locks

File-level isolation comes from per-Player git worktrees: two Players editing the same file do so in isolated trees. Conflict surfaces at merge, a much cleaner failure mode than a held lock from a crashed agent.

`coord_acquire_lock` / `coord_release_lock` from the original spec are **not implemented**. They were to be advisory-only for cross-worktree logical resources ("only one Player runs the migration") — deferred until a real use-case appears.

### 6.3 Cost caps

Enforced **before** `agent_started` is emitted so a capped attempt doesn't count as a turn in the audit log.

- Per-agent daily: `HARNESS_AGENT_DAILY_CAP` (default $5.00). 0 disables.
- Team daily: `HARNESS_TEAM_DAILY_CAP` (default $20.00). 0 disables.
- Both computed by summing `cost_usd` from `result` events emitted today (UTC).
- Blocked spawns emit a `cost_capped` event with the reason string.

### 6.4 Global pause

`POST /api/pause {paused: bool}` flips an in-memory flag. When paused:
- `run_agent` emits `paused` and returns (cheaper than the cost-cap check; no DB write).
- Coach autoloop skips ticks.
- In-flight turns are **not** cancelled (use `cancel-all` for that).

Persists via `pause_toggled` WS event so multi-tab UIs stay in sync. Restart clears the flag.

### 6.5 Coach autonomous loop

Env-gated by `HARNESS_COACH_TICK_INTERVAL` (seconds; 0 disables).
- Sleep-first pattern — first tick doesn't fire before workspaces/DB are ready.
- Skips when Coach is already working or harness is paused.
- Manually triggerable: `POST /api/coach/tick` (409 if Coach busy).
- Prompt: the `COACH_TICK_PROMPT` constant ("Routine tick. Read your inbox…").

### 6.6 Task hierarchy

- Top-level task: Coach creates via `coord_create_task` (no parent_id), or human via `POST /api/tasks`.
- Subtask: Player creates under their current task via `coord_create_task`. Schema supports unlimited depth.
- Done/cancelled clears the owner's `current_task_id`.
- Cancel cascades only to the owner's pointer, NOT to subtasks (intentional — matches `coord_update_task` behavior).

---

## 7. Events (the audit log + live WS stream)

### 7.1 Mechanics

- `publish(event)` fans out to every live WS subscriber via `asyncio.Queue`, then fires `asyncio.create_task(_persist(event))` for SQLite.
- No backlog replay on subscribe (duplicate events would pollute the UI; UI reads `GET /api/events` for history).
- Heartbeat ping every 30 s of quiet over WS (type `ping`, filtered out of conversations client-side).
- Client watchdog: if no message for 60 s, force-close WS → reconnect. Bumps `wsAttempt` state to re-run the effect.

### 7.2 Event type catalogue

Agent lifecycle:
- `agent_started` (fields: prompt, resumed_session)
- `text`
- `tool_use` (id, name, input)
- `tool_result` (tool_use_id, content, is_error)
- `result` (duration_ms, cost_usd, session_id, is_error)
- `error`
- `agent_stopped`
- `agent_cancelled`
- `cost_capped` (reason, prompt)
- `paused` (prompt) — spawn refused while paused
- `session_cleared`

Tasks:
- `task_created`
- `task_claimed`
- `task_assigned`
- `task_updated` (old_status, new_status, note)

Coord / comms:
- `message_sent` (to, subject, body_preview, priority)
- `memory_updated` (topic, version, size)
- `decision_written` (title, filename, location, size)
- `commit_pushed` (sha, message, pushed, push_requested)
- `human_attention` (subject, body, urgency ∈ {normal, blocker})
- `player_assigned` (player_id, name, role)
- `pause_toggled` (paused)

---

## 8. MCP `coord_` tools

All served by `build_coord_server(slot)` — the per-caller closure knows which agent invoked the tool, so no agent has to pass its own identity. Registered as in-process MCP tools on each SDK query.

| Tool | Coach | Player | Effect |
|------|:-----:|:------:|--------|
| `coord_list_tasks` | ✓ | ✓ | Filter by status / owner |
| `coord_create_task` | ✓ (top-level) | ✓ (subtasks only, must parent to owned task) | |
| `coord_claim_task` | — | ✓ | Claim open task; refuses if already owning one |
| `coord_update_task` | ✓ (any) | ✓ (own) | Valid transitions: open→claimed→in_progress→(blocked\|done\|cancelled). Clears owner's current_task_id on done/cancelled. |
| `coord_assign_task` | ✓ | — | Push-assign to a specific Player; emits `task_assigned` |
| `coord_send_message` | ✓ | ✓ | Recipients: coach / p1..p10 / broadcast; priority: normal / interrupt |
| `coord_read_inbox` | ✓ | ✓ | Marks messages read per-recipient (broadcast-safe via `message_reads`) |
| `coord_list_memory` | ✓ | ✓ | List topics |
| `coord_read_memory` | ✓ | ✓ | Read content |
| `coord_update_memory` | ✓ | ✓ | Full overwrite; mirrors to kDrive; emits `memory_updated` |
| `coord_commit_push` | — | ✓ | `git add -A && commit && push origin HEAD` in the Player's worktree |
| `coord_write_decision` | ✓ | — | Append-only markdown in `decisions/<date>-<slug>.md` |
| `coord_set_player_role` | ✓ | — | Write agents.name / role; emits `player_assigned` |
| `coord_request_human` | ✓ | ✓ | Emit `human_attention` event; urgency ∈ {normal, blocker} |

### 8.1 Standard SDK tools

- **Both kinds**: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `ToolSearch`.
- **Players only**: `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`.

Coach structurally cannot modify code — enforces "you delegate, never implement".

### 8.2 Dropped from original spec

- `coord_acquire_lock` / `coord_release_lock` — deferred; per-worktree isolation covers primary need.
- `coord_heartbeat` — SDK `ResultMessage` already updates heartbeat via `_set_status`.

---

## 9. Agent lifecycle

### 9.1 Per-turn flow (`run_agent`)

1. **Paused check** — if paused, emit `paused` and return (no DB writes).
2. **Cost cap check** — per-agent and team daily. Blocked attempts emit `cost_capped`.
3. **Session load** — read prior `session_id` from agents table (for SDK resume).
4. Emit `agent_started` with `resumed_session: bool`. Set status `working`.
5. Build `ClaudeAgentOptions`:
   - `system_prompt` — role-specific (Coach vs Player template).
   - `cwd` — `/workspaces/<slot>`.
   - `max_turns=10`.
   - `mcp_servers={"coord": coord_server}`.
   - `allowed_tools` — ALLOWED_COACH_TOOLS or ALLOWED_PLAYER_TOOLS.
   - `model` — per-pane override if set.
   - `permission_mode="plan"` — if plan_mode override set.
   - `effort` — if effort override set (1..4 → "low"/"medium"/"high"/"max").
   - `resume=<session_id>` — if non-null.
6. Register task in `_running_tasks[slot]` so `POST /api/agents/<id>/cancel` can abort.
7. Stream SDK messages:
   - `AssistantMessage` → emit `text` / `tool_use` events.
   - `UserMessage` (carries tool results) → emit `tool_result`.
   - `ResultMessage` → emit `result`, persist session_id, add to cost_estimate_usd.
8. Exception handling:
   - `asyncio.CancelledError` → emit `agent_cancelled`, set status idle, re-raise.
   - Other → emit `error`, set status error.
   - Else → set status idle.
9. Always emit `agent_stopped` and pop from `_running_tasks`.

### 9.2 Per-turn overrides (via `POST /api/agents/start`)

| Field | Type | Maps to |
|-------|------|---------|
| `model` | str | SDK `model` |
| `plan_mode` | bool | SDK `permission_mode="plan"` |
| `effort` | 1..4 | SDK `effort` literal |

All optional; stored per-pane in localStorage (`harness_pane_settings_v1`).

### 9.3 Cancellation

- `POST /api/agents/<id>/cancel` — 409 if agent isn't running.
- `POST /api/agents/cancel-all` — iterates every in-flight task. Registered **before** the path-param version so "cancel-all" doesn't match as an agent_id.
- Cancellation propagates via `task.cancel()` → `CancelledError` in the SDK query loop → run_agent's except branch cleanly ends.

### 9.4 Session resume (M5 step 2)

- `ResultMessage.session_id` captured and persisted per-turn.
- Next turn reads it, passes as `resume=<id>` to `ClaudeAgentOptions`.
- `DELETE /api/agents/<id>/session` clears the stored id — next run starts fresh. UI exposes this via a × next to the ● session indicator in the pane header.

### 9.5 Crash recovery (minimum viable)

- On restart, `init_db()` is idempotent — schema + seed agents restore cleanly.
- Hourly `VACUUM INTO` snapshots give fresh-VPS recovery (copy snapshot back into `/data/harness.db`).
- Tasks left in `in_progress` on crash are NOT auto-reset (original spec had this; deferred — can be added if incidents show it's needed).

---

## 10. HTTP API

All paths under `/api/*` except `/api/health` require `Authorization: Bearer $HARNESS_TOKEN` when the env var is set. WS uses `?token=` query param.

### 10.1 Readiness & observability

- `GET /api/health` (public) — per-subsystem probe: db / static / claude_cli / kdrive / workspaces. 200 when all required green; 503 otherwise. Body always carries `{checks: {...}}`.
- `GET /api/status` — version, uptime, host, `paused`, `running_slots`, `ws_subscribers`, `caps` (per-agent / team / today), kdrive status, workspaces status.

### 10.2 Agents

- `GET /api/agents`
- `POST /api/agents/start` `{agent_id, prompt, model?, plan_mode?, effort?}`
- `POST /api/agents/cancel-all`
- `POST /api/agents/{id}/cancel` (409 if not running)
- `DELETE /api/agents/{id}/session`

### 10.3 Pause

- `GET /api/pause` → `{paused: bool}`
- `POST /api/pause` `{paused: bool}` → emits `pause_toggled` on transition

### 10.4 Tasks

- `GET /api/tasks`
- `POST /api/tasks` `{title, description?, priority?, parent_id?}` (created_by='human')
- `POST /api/tasks/{id}/cancel` (idempotent; clears owner's current_task_id)

### 10.5 Messages

- `GET /api/messages?limit=N` — recent (≤ 200) newest-first
- `POST /api/messages` `{to, subject?, body, priority?}` — queues from human; emits `message_sent`

### 10.6 Memory

- `GET /api/memory` — topic index
- `GET /api/memory/{topic}` — full content
- `POST /api/memory` `{topic, content}` — human upsert; emits `memory_updated`

### 10.7 Decisions

- `GET /api/decisions`
- `GET /api/decisions/{filename}`

### 10.8 Events

- `GET /api/events?agent=&type=&since_id=&limit=` — history for pane restore or filtered view

### 10.9 Coach tick

- `POST /api/coach/tick` — fires a Coach drain; 409 if Coach is busy

### 10.10 Attachments

- `POST /api/attachments` (multipart) — pasted images → `/data/attachments`; each workspace has a symlink `/workspaces/<slot>/attachments/` pointing there

---

## 11. WebSocket `/ws`

- Single connection at app-root.
- Auth: `?token=<HARNESS_TOKEN>` query (browsers can't set Authorization on WS).
- Server→client:
  - `{"type": "connected"}` on accept.
  - `{"type": "ping"}` every 30 s of quiet.
  - All domain events (same envelope shape as persisted event rows).
- Client doesn't send — subscription is implicit (every subscriber gets every event).
- Client watchdog: see §7.1.

---

## 12. UI

### 12.1 Global layout

- **Left rail** (44 px, vertical): WS dot (pulses red when disconnected), Coach + p1..p10 slot buttons, separator, cancel-all (shown only when agents are working), pause toggle, env-panel toggle (▦), settings gear.
- **Panes area** (center, flex): 2D layout — array of columns, each a vertical stack of agent panes. Split.js horizontal gutters between columns; vertical gutters inside stacked columns. Drop zones at bottom of each column (append) + right edge (new column).
- **Env pane** (right, 340 px, toggleable via ⌘/Ctrl+B): Attention / Tasks / Cost / Inbox / Memory / Decisions / Timeline sections. ↓ team-export button in header.

### 12.2 Slot interactions

- Click closed slot → open as new column on the right.
- Click already-open slot → scroll pane into view horizontally.
- Shift-click → stack into rightmost column.
- Drag pane label → drop on another pane (insert before), bottom strip (append), right rail (new column).

### 12.3 Persistence (localStorage)

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `harness_layout_v1` | openColumns + envOpen |
| `harness_split_sizes_v1` | Split.js sizes per layout signature (capped 30 keys) |
| `harness_pane_settings_v1` | per-slot model / plan_mode / effort |
| `harness_prompt_history_v1` | per-slot last 40 submitted prompts |
| `harness_task_filter_v1` | active / all / done |
| `harness_attention_dismissed_v1` | dismissed human_attention event ids (capped 200) |

### 12.4 Keyboard shortcuts

Global (ignored in form fields):
- **⌘/Ctrl+B** — toggle env panel.
- **⌘/Ctrl+.** — toggle pause.

Inside a pane input:
- **⌘/Ctrl+Enter** — send.
- **⌘/Ctrl+↑/↓** — cycle prompt history.
- **Escape** (in search / settings popover) — close.
- Paste image → `/api/attachments` → adds path to prompt.

### 12.5 Tab title

Composed from live state: `[⏸] [N⚡] [M●] TeamOfTen` where ⏸=paused, N⚡=working count, M●=unread slots.

### 12.6 Pane header (left to right)

- Status dot (idle / working / error / stopped) — tooltip: status + last heartbeat + first-started (relative times).
- Slot id · displayed name · role.
- ⚑ Current-task chip (title truncated to 24 chars; full title in tooltip).
- ● session id indicator + × to clear.
- `$X.XXX` cumulative cost chip.
- `Ns · $X.XXX` last-turn duration + cost (hidden while working).
- ⏹ Cancel (only visible when status=working).
- Override dot (accent color) when any per-turn setting is non-default.
- ⌕ In-pane search toggle (filters body by substring match; Escape clears).
- ↓ Export conversation as markdown.
- ⚙ Settings popover (model / plan_mode / effort).
- × Close pane.

### 12.7 Pane body

- Loads up to 500 events on mount from `/api/events?agent=<slot>&limit=500`.
- Merges persisted + live WS events, deduped by `__id`.
- Pairs `tool_use` ↔ `tool_result` → renders `tool_result` INSIDE its `tool_use` card.
- Auto-scroll to bottom IF user was near bottom (< 80 px).
- Per-tool renderers (`tools.js`):
  - Read — image preview for image paths.
  - Edit — red/green diff card.
  - Bash / Grep / Glob — inline output summary.
  - `coord_*` tools — structured input + result display.
  - Generic fallback for unknown tools.
- Empty-pane hint cards with starter prompts (Coach-specific vs Player-specific).

### 12.8 EnvPane sections

1. **Attention** (pinned banner when any undismissed `human_attention` exists) — loads persisted + live events; dismissed set in localStorage keyed by `__id`.
2. **Tasks** — active/all/done filter (persisted). Subtasks indented with ↳. × cancel button per active row. Bottom form creates top-level task as 'human'.
3. **Cost** — per-agent list sorted by spend, total, caps display.
4. **Inbox** — 50 most recent messages. Click to expand full body. `+ send` opens composer (to / subject / body / priority).
5. **Memory** — topic list with version + last_updated_by. Click to expand. `+ write` opens composer.
6. **Decisions** — append-only list. Click to expand full markdown.
7. **Timeline** — flat chronological stream of overview-worthy event types (capped last 80, sticky-to-bottom).

### 12.9 Settings drawer

- **Health** section: runtime strip (paused / running / ws subs) + per-subsystem dots + ↻ refresh.
- **Authentication**: copy for the `claude /login` device-code flow.
- **Cost caps**: read-only display (edit via env vars).
- **kDrive mirror**: enabled/disabled + reason.
- **Layout**: "Reset resize state" clears `harness_split_sizes_v1` and reloads.
- **About**: shortcut reference.

---

## 13. Security & auth

### 13.1 To Claude

`claude /login` device-code flow, run **once per host**:
1. On the VPS, run `claude` (interactive REPL).
2. At `>` prompt, type `/login`.
3. CLI prints URL + short code.
4. Open URL on laptop, sign in to Max account, enter code, approve.
5. Token persisted to OS credential store (NOT `~/.claude.json`).
6. Exit REPL; non-interactive `claude -p "…"` works from any shell on that host.

**Implications**:
- Redeploys erase the container filesystem — token must sit on a mounted volume or every redeploy re-requires `/login`.
- The install script `https://claude.ai/install.sh` is geo-blocked in Zeabur's EU datacenter (403). Dockerfile installs via `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` — `registry.npmjs.org` is reachable, and `api.anthropic.com` is not blocked at runtime.

### 13.2 To the UI

- `HARNESS_TOKEN` env var, optional.
- When set: every `/api/*` except `/api/health` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; WS uses `?token=`.
- UI shows a TokenGate overlay on 401 (stores in localStorage, reload).
- Unset env = open API (single-user personal harness, no public exposure intended).

### 13.3 kDrive

- `KDRIVE_WEBDAV_URL` + `KDRIVE_USER` + `KDRIVE_APP_PASSWORD` + `KDRIVE_ROOT_PATH` (defaults `/harness`).
- App-specific password from Infomaniak panel (NOT main password).
- All four checked on boot; enabled only if all four present.

---

## 14. Deployment

### 14.1 Dockerfile

- Base: `python:3.12-slim`.
- Adds: Node 20 (NodeSource), `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, git.
- Default git identity: `"TeamOfTen Harness" <harness@teamoften.local>`.
- Pre-creates `/workspaces/{coach,p1..p10,default}` with `/attachments/` symlinks.
- Does NOT pre-create `/data` — Zeabur's volume mount over an existing directory hangs SQLite silently (confirmed 2026-04-22).

### 14.2 Zeabur

- GitHub auto-pull from `main`.
- Volume mount at `/data` for SQLite persistence.
- Env vars set in service panel.
- TLS / ingress handled by Zeabur — no Caddy needed.

## 15. Test suite

Under `server/tests/`, pytest-asyncio auto mode, DB-level (no FastAPI TestClient so the suite doesn't pull `claude-agent-sdk` at import time).

- `test_db.py` — schema smoke, 11-agent seed, idempotent init. (3 tests)
- `test_events.py` — bus publish/subscribe/persist round-trip; late-subscriber has empty backlog (invariant). (3 tests)
- `test_tools_consts.py` — VALID_RECIPIENTS shape, MEMORY_TOPIC_RE accept/reject, coord-tool name prefix, Coach/Player allowlist split. (7 tests)
- `test_tasks_sm.py` — status default, CHECK constraint enforcement on status + kind, cancel clears owner. (4 tests)

**Total: 17 tests.** Run: `uv sync --extra dev && uv run pytest`.

**Pending / next likely:**
- Mobile UI polish (HTML5 DnD doesn't fire on touch; layout breakpoints for < 900 px need a rethink).
- Pane collapse (minimize to header) — deferred because fighting Split.js's inline sizes is non-trivial.
- Automated crash-recovery (reset in_progress tasks on restart) — wait for real incidents before prioritizing.
- Daily/weekly digest generation by Coach — needs the autoloop running regularly first.

---

## 17. Open questions (from original spec + new)

### 17.1 From the original spec (§15)

1. **Opus for Coach?** — Coach does more reasoning, less typing. Pane settings popover supports per-turn override, so de facto answer is "yes, when needed". No automatic default.
2. **Weekly Max-plan usage cap?** — Not implemented. Per-agent + team daily is the current bound.
3. **Agent self-termination on task done?** — Currently each turn ends after one pass through the SDK query loop; agent doesn't re-loop without a new prompt. Coach autoloop handles "wake up periodically".
4. **Multi-repo support?** — One HARNESS_PROJECT_REPO; no routing for multiple. Extensible but not built.
5. **Record/replay?** — Event log enables replay; no replay tooling built.
6. **Conflict detection across worktrees?** — None yet; merge-at-the-end is the fallback.
7. **Hard cost caps vs soft warnings?** — Current caps are HARD (reject spawn). No soft-warn mode.

### 17.2 New, from shipping

8. **Daily digest generation** — spec'd but not written. Coach autoloop is the hook; a `coord_write_digest` tool + scheduled UTC-00:00 tick would do it.
9. **Session_id rotation policy** — right now sessions can live forever (until user clicks × on the header dot). Auto-rotate after N turns?
10. **Memory deletion** — intentionally no delete tool. If noise accumulates, user edits content to empty string or overwrites the topic.
11. **Broadcast message delivery ordering** — message_reads tracks per-recipient, but delivery to inboxes is whatever order `read_inbox` fires in. Acceptable.
12. **Agent crash in the middle of tool call** — run_agent's try/except catches it, emits `error`. The tool call may have partially committed (e.g. task updated but message not sent). Best-effort; no two-phase commit.

---

## 18. Abandoned / not-taken decisions

- **rclone daemon** — dropped in favor of direct WebDAV via webdav4. No daemon to supervise; clean sync control.
- **React + react-mosaic + Vite** — dropped in favor of Preact + htm + Split.js (no build step).
- **Zustand** — dropped; plain hooks are enough.
- **Docker Compose with Caddy** — dropped; Zeabur handles TLS / ingress.
- **Copying `~/.claude.json` across hosts** — dropped per M-1 spike; tokens live in OS credential store.
- **`scripts/copy-claude-auth.sh`** — deleted from the plan.
- **`tailscale-only` public exposure model** — deferred; current deploy is public with optional bearer token.
- **Pydantic models for Agent / Task / Message / MemoryDoc** — replaced with plain SQLite rows + request-shape Pydantic validators.
- **`coord_acquire_lock` / `coord_release_lock`** — deferred; per-worktree isolation suffices.
- **Per-worktree `git` pre-commit conflict hook** — not built.
- **`coord_heartbeat`** — SDK `ResultMessage` already updates heartbeat via `_set_status`.
- **Multiple layout presets ("overview", "focus", "debug")** — dropped; manual layout + localStorage persistence is enough.
- **Command palette (Cmd+K)** — not built; ⌘/Ctrl+B / ⌘/Ctrl+. cover the common toggles.
- **PWA manifest + push notifications** — deferred to mobile polish; not built.
- **Pane drag-to-pop-out-window** — not built.
- **Layout presets persistence** — not built; single persisted layout per browser.

## 19. Guarantees (hard invariants)

1. No agent writes SQLite directly — every mutation funnels through an MCP tool handler in the server process.
2. Cost caps enforced **before** `agent_started` is emitted so capped attempts don't count as turns.
3. Task cancel clears the owner's `current_task_id` so the Player is unblocked for the next claim.
4. Pause blocks new starts + autoloop ticks; in-flight turns continue until they complete or are explicitly cancelled.
5. `human_attention` events survive restarts (DB-persisted + API-fetched by the UI banner).
6. Session resume across turns unless explicitly cleared via `DELETE /api/agents/<id>/session`.
7. Coach is structurally incapable of modifying code (no Write/Edit/Bash tools in its allowlist).

---

## 20. Known gotchas (from CLAUDE.md)

1. Claude CLI OAuth tokens do NOT live in `~/.claude.json`. Use `claude /login` per host.
2. Zeabur's default region 403s `claude.ai/install.sh`. Dockerfile installs via npm.
3. Do NOT pre-create `/data` in the image — Zeabur's volume mount over an existing dir hangs SQLite silently at startup.
4. `.gitattributes` forces LF on `*.sh` and `Dockerfile*`. New scripts need the same or they fail in Linux containers with `$'\r': command not found`.
5. SQLite WAL journal mode hangs on Zeabur volumes — stick to DELETE journal mode.

---

## 21. What this is not

- Not a product. Personal tool.
- Not secure enough for untrusted users. Single-user by design.
- Not a replacement for Claude Agent Teams — this is specifically **more transparent and less automagical**.
- Not going to solve "how do I get 10 Claudes to build an app with no input from me." Human remains in the loop.
